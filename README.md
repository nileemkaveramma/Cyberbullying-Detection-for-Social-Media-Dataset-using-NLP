# Cyberbullying-Detection-for-Social-Media-Dataset-using-NLP

Cyber Bullying is a major digital age problem today with numerous social media platforms becoming more popular. The project directed to Natural Language Processing systems that can be used for processing of the data in various forms on various social media channels to detect cyber bullying and summarize the facts and discovered ones. The NLP methods shall recognize some patterns, to impart some knowledge through this knowledge on cyberbullying-the result of its psychological or emotional repercussions. It provides that such a development is only expected to enable policymakers and citizens responsible for moderating the platforms to establish a more secure digital environment with operationable facts regarding the trends in cyberbullying consumption. While it has completely transformed the way people communicate, on the other hand, it has further escalated the rise in crimes of cybersecurity. This project attempts to bridge this concern through use of NLP advanced techniques to analyze, classify, and
summarize data from social media and thus provide a solution for technology to extirpate online abuse. 

Methodology

● Dataset Loading and Exploration: Importing the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data. 

● Data Cleaning: Removing noise such as URLs, mentions, hashtags, and stopwords from the text to ensure clean input for analysis. ● Feature Extraction: Employing techniques such as Bag-of-Words (BoW) or TF-IDF to transform the cleaned text into a structured format for processing.

● Classification: Using machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression) to categorize text into cyberbullying-related categories. 

● Summarization: Extracting meaningful summaries from the processed data related to victims of cybercrimes.
